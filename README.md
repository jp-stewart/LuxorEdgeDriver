# LuxorEdgeDriver
FX Luminaire Luxor SmartThings Edge Driver

Initially written and created by J.P. Stewart in August of 2023, with help, inspiration and ideas from other online edge drivers.

This was my first edge driver I have written.
The patterns within are not as great as I review the code now (currently December 2024).
I have since created several other edge drivers, so am more familiar with the object design patterns.

Suggestions and edits are somewhat welcome, but consider this code not maintained or tested.
There is no SLA for bugs/issues/responses.

I am _using_ this driver however at home, so it "works" for us.
That's the level of testing it has gone through, we control some limited groups, and we do not have any colors on our controller.

If you would like to use this driver on your own smartthings hub. You can subscribe to it here:<br>

Please be kind.
Thanks.
